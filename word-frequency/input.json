    "input": "The competition dataset comprises text passages that have been rewritten by the Gemma LLM according to some rewrite_prompt instruction. The goal of the competition is to determine what prompt was used to rewrite each original text.  Please note that this is a Code Competition. When your submission is scored, this example test data will be replaced with the full test set. Expect roughly 2,000 original texts in the test set."
